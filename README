Blister is an extremely fast, scalable, C++ library for building async I/O
servers and clients. It includes optimized, lightweight logging, configuration,
networking and process/thread control.

Linux, Solaris, MacOSX, BSD and Windows systems are supported. Windows
includes a lightweight POSIX emulation layer to make porting UNIX code simpler

Echo and HTTP servers are available as samples. SMTP and HTTP load clients
are also included to help with performance testing. A dlog program can be used
by other tools to enable common logging features such as rollover and size
management
