servers and clients. It includes optimized, lightweight logging, configuration,
networking and process/thread control.

Linux, Solaris, MacOS and Windows systems are supported. Windows includes a
lightweight POSIX emulation layer to make porting UNIX code simpler

Echo and HTTP servers are available as samples. SMTP and HTTP load clients
are also included to help with performance testing. A dlog program can be used
