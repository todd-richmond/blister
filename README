Blister is an extremely fast, scaleable, C++ library for building async I/O
servers and clients. It includes optimized, lightweight logging, configuration,
networking and process/thread control.

Linux, Solaris, MacOS and Windows systems are supported with Windows using an
included lightweight POSIX emulation layer.

Sample echo, HTTP servers are available as samples. SMTP and HTTP load clients
are also included to help with performance testing.


To build on UNIX, run the build/build script. For Windows, use the Visual Studio
2008 solution file.
